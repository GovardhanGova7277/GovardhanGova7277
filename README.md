### 💡 About Me

I'm a passionate technologist who believes in the power of technology to transform the world. My journey in tech is driven by my curiosity and commitment to learning, which is reflected in my academic achievements and the projects I've undertaken.

I have honed my skills through internships at **YBI Foundation** and **Capabl**, focusing on **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**. My technical toolkit includes:

- **Programming Languages:** Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL
- **Frameworks:** Django
- **Certifications:** Full-stack web development, data analysis, machine learning

Beyond technical skills, I actively contribute to my university community. I led the **UX BLITZ** competition, a UI/UX event during our fest, where I also organized workshops to inspire creativity among students.
